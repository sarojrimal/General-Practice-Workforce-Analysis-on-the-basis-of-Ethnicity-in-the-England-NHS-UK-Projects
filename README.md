## Background
The United Kingdom serves as a residence for a diverse population comprising both natives and immigrants, encompassing individuals from various traditions, backgrounds, and countries. These individuals come to the UK for purposes such as employment, education, and settlement.

This project endeavors to conduct a comprehensive analysis of individuals of different nationalities working within a specific sector of the NHS, namely General Practice (GP) in England. The study encompasses data from various categories of GP workers, including administrative and non-clinical staff, nurses, and all personnel directly involved in patient care. The data for this project is collected from the NHS digital (Home — NHS Digital) covering the period from September 2015 to August 2023.

## Conclusion:
Based on our comprehensive analysis and findings, it is evident that individuals of White ethnicity comprise a significant portion of the General Practice (GP) workforce in England. This prevalence can be attributed to the common occurrence of native individuals pursuing employment opportunities within government institutions like the NHS. Nonetheless, individuals from other ethnic backgrounds also have opportunities to contribute to the UK government, albeit in lesser numbers compared to the White community.

Asian and British Asian individuals emerge as the next favored demographic after White individuals in terms of employment within General Practices across England. While White individuals predominantly occupy GP roles in most locations throughout England, the demographic landscape shifts notably in the London area, where Asian individuals are more prominently represented within the GP workforce.

Overall, while there are common trends such as the dominance of individuals from White ethnic backgrounds across many regions, there are also variations that reflect the diversity of the population and workforce across different parts of England. This underscores the importance of considering regional dynamics and demographics in workforce planning and policy-making within the healthcare sector. It’s important to note that data for some regions may be limited or unavailable, as indicated by the reference to “unknown areas” and “undisclosed areas” where specific demographic breakdowns are not provided from the source.
